(from the GIT shortlog)
* Undo the change in platform.txt for 1.6.6
* Add pins for SD_DFLASH and CS_SD to match the names on Autonomo rev4
* Avoid using void* in an arithmetic expression (in USBDeviceClass::send)
* Correct a few types in dtostrf.c to eliminate compilation warnings
* Changed to using floor(val) instea of iPart.
* This adds zeros after the decimal point if required.
* Added support for zero decimal places.
* A fix for the String class conversion of floats/doubles.
* Add strncpy_P and strncmp_P defines in pgmspace.h
* Add a a few missing enum values for ADC and TCx in WVariant.h
* Changed hardcoded A0 for DAC in analogWrite()
* Adding initialisation of TC6 & TC7
* Added the same clock divider rule as the G18
* Remove USB_HOST_ENABLE, we don't have the hardware to output USB power
* Make prototype of Serial_::begin consistent with implementation
* Add boards.txt, platform.txt and variants (for Autonomo)
