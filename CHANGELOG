* Changed hardcoded A0 for DAC in analogWrite()
* Adding initialisation of TC6 & TC7
* Added the same clock divider rule as the G18

SODAQ SAMD CORE v1.6.6-sodaq

SODAQ SAMD CORE v1.6.5-sodaq

SODAQ SAMD CORE v1.6.4-sodaq

This version is based of commit 90e234f, plus
(from the GIT shortlog)
* Undo the change in platform.txt for 1.6.6
* Add pins for SD_DFLASH and CS_SD to match the names on Autonomo rev4
* Avoid using void* in an arithmetic expression (in USBDeviceClass::send)
* Correct a few types in dtostrf.c to eliminate compilation warnings
* Changed to using floor(val) instea of iPart.
* This adds zeros after the decimal point if required.
* Added support for zero decimal places.
* A fix for the String class conversion of floats/doubles.
* Add strncpy_P and strncmp_P defines in pgmspace.h
* Add a a few missing enum values for ADC and TCx in WVariant.h
* Changed hardcoded A0 for DAC in analogWrite()
* Adding initialisation of TC6 & TC7
* Added the same clock divider rule as the G18
* Remove USB_HOST_ENABLE, we don't have the hardware to output USB power
* Make prototype of Serial_::begin consistent with implementation
* Add boards.txt, platform.txt and variants (for Autonomo)

SAMD CORE 1.6.5 2016.04.02

* Added Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 board
* Set NVMCTRL.MANW bit to 1 (default is 0). This prevents accidental writes on program memory.
* Bootloader: Fixed wrong UART speed (regression)
* Fixed incorrect return value from Wire.available() when the receive buffer is not fully read.
* Added DAC0 definition in Arduino/Genuino Zero variant file.
* Enabled bootloader protection after "Burn bootloader".

SAMD CORE 1.6.4 2016.02.19

* Fixed Wire address setup when running as slave.
* Fixed String constructor when using floating point numbers.
* USBHost: fixed blocking USBHost.Task(). Thanks @bbx10
* USBHost: fixed some ASCII Control codes in keyboard controller. Thanks @bbx10
* USBHost: ported some minor fix from upstream UHS2. Thanks @bbx10
* USBHost: fixed wrong library initialization. Thanks @bbx10 @ladyada
* better interrupt handling in Serial::accept()

SAMD CORE 1.6.3 2016.02.15

* Added drivers for Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 board
* Fixed Wire master repeated start behaviour
* Added SerialUSB methods: readBreak(), baud(), stopbits(), paritytype(), numbits(), dtr(), rts()
* Added SPI.transfer16(..) method
* Bugfix: added missing Serial.begin(baud, config) method. Thanks @tuxedo0801
* Fixed Serial baudrate calculations for 1200bps. Thanks @TomKeddie
* Fixed Serial.flush() that now waits until the last bit has been sent. Thanks @TomKeddie
* Fixed Serial configuration for data-bit. Thanks @TomKeddie
* Bootloader: 32Khz external oscillator is now used, improves USB clock. Thanks @aethaniel
* Bootloader: Clean up of makefiles and file organization. Thanks @aethaniel
* Added PWM capability to pins A1/A2 of Arduino Zero.
* variant.h/cpp: PWM capability is now determined by PIN_ATTR_PWM combined with
                 PIN_ATTR_TIMER or PIN_ATTR_TIMER_ALT for timer selection.
* Small fix to USBHost example "USB_desc.ino". Thanks @bbx10
* USBHost: USB-Keyboard right shift key was ignored. Thanks @bbx10 
* Wire library now support multiple instances in variant. Thanks @spiderkeys
* Ported some SerialUSB API (readBreak(), baud(), stopbits(), paritytype(), numbits(), dtr(), rts())
